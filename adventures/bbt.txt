# New adventure based on Big Bang theory
# Sheldon has to be driven to Caltech
# There's all kinds of set-backs and obstacles
# A bit of trivia
# Some puzzles
# A fight with an alien that comes from a portal Sheldon made
# Car trouble in Penny's car because of the neglected "Check Engine" light
# Map of the two apartments
# Stairs, no elevator
# Route to Caltech
# Stops at Amy's, Raj's, the comic book store, Bernadette and Howards's place

# Op straat staan twee auto's: Die van Leonard (hiervoor heb je sleutels) en die van Penny (nog geen sleutels)
# Met car keys van Leonard instappen lukt, maar starten niet. (modifier: penny in haar living room, in paniek omdat haar kleren gestolen zijn).
# Dan Penny overtuigen om met haar auto te mogen gaan (door haar haar kleren te geven krijg je haar autosleutels)
# Die strandt natuurlijk met motorpech
# Maar wel in de buurt van de comic book store
# Daar Stuart om hulp vragen en dan krijg je een onderdeel waarmee Penny's auto het weer doet.
#	Bij vragen geeft Stuart aan dat hij wel wil helpen, maar dat hij dat niet voor niets doet en wil ruilen voor een zeldzaam stripboek van Sheldon
#	Na het verlaten van de winkel moet je (en kun je nu ook) helemaal teruglopen naar het appartement en in Sheldon's slaapkamer is nu het stripboek te vinden.
#	Dan weer helemaal teruglopen en Stuart wil nu ruilen.
#	Met dat item kun je nu weer in de auto stappen en wegrijden

# Caltech
#	Barry ligt natuurlijk dwars
#	Je moet naar de kelder en daar het wezen uit de andere dimensie verslaan
#	Amy, Bernadette, Howard en Raj moeten natuurlijk ook nog een rol krijgen

# Na afloop moet je nog weer naar huis. De auto haalt het net en in het appartement zitten alle anderen al te wachten met take-out. Iedereen eet gezellig in de woonkamer.

RoomID:living
Name:Sheldon and Leonard's living room
Description:This is our familiar living room, isn't it? It's remarkable how time seems to warp within these walls. I can barely recall moving in, yet here we still are after all these years.<p>Living with Sheldon certainly doesn't accelerate the passage of time; rather, it feels as though each day stretches on interminably. Some moments expand into what feel like subjective eternities, while entire weeks sometimes vanish without a trace - lost in a fog of meticulously planned routines and unwavering principles.<p>It makes you wonder if certain living arrangements exist outside the normal flow of temporal experience...

NegativeAskResponse:That falls outside my current domain of expertise. If I had been informed this inquiry would be posed, I would have allocated the requisite neural processing power for its consideration. Your failure to provide adequate notice is not a deficiency I am prepared to accept responsibility for.
NegativeTradeResponse:While I acknowledge the gesture, the item in question lacks characteristics aligned with my acquisition parameters. The transfer would represent a suboptimal allocation of resources - a concept I trust you understand is fundamentally inefficient.

Description:The bathroom presents a unique challenge in terms of optimizing space utilization given our differing needs and preferences. While not ideal, we've established certain protocols to maintain acceptable levels of hygiene and organization. Sheldon maintains strict standards regarding cleanliness - requiring daily surface disinfection and precise towel folding techniques that I generally comply with.

RoomID:bedroomsheldon
Name:Sheldon's bedroom
Description:Stepping into Sheldon's bedroom is like entering a display model rather than a lived-in space - everything is precisely arranged according to established protocols. The walls are painted a neutral beige with minimal decorative elements beyond framed certificates and diagrams related to his academic achievements. The focal point of the room is undoubtedly the bed, which is made with surgical precision. The rest of the room follows a similar pattern: comic books are shelved alphabetically by author then chronologically by publication date; clothing items hang uniformly spaced in the closet; surfaces remain clear of clutter. Even seemingly random objects like desk organizers and charging stations adhere to strict geometric principles. It's not necessarily cozy or inviting in the conventional sense - more like an optimized environment designed for efficiency rather than relaxation - reflecting Sheldon's functional approach to all aspects of his life.

Description:The familiar chaos of Penny's living room greets you - throw pillows scattered like fallen soldiers, a landscape of magazines across the coffee table, and that indefinable layer of comfortable disarray that only comes from truly living in a space.<p>Across the room, Sheldon's face betrayed his internal battle; his eyes darted around cataloging the deviations from perfect alignment while his lips tightened against the instinctive urge to impose order. You could practically hear him calculating the precise trajectory needed to realign each object with maximum efficiency - a silent symphony of control battling a wave of joyful messiness.

RoomID:kitchenpenny
Name:Kitchen
Description:Penny's kitchen presented a study in functional minimalism - counters wiped clean, appliances neatly arranged, and cabinets free from clutter. It was undeniably organized, suggesting someone who valued efficiency and order in at least one domain of her life.<p>Yet something felt missing; the space lacked the lived-in warmth that comes with genuine culinary passion. There were no overflowing spice racks, no handwritten recipe cards pinned to the fridge, no evidence of joyful experimentation - just a clean slate awaiting its next utilitarian purpose. It was clear this kitchen served as a means rather than an end in itself, reflecting Penny's approach to cooking as sustenance rather than celebration.

The eclectic assortment of personal items - framed prints, candles, soaps - suggest a space curated for comfort rather than strict aesthetic uniformity.

RoomID:cbsstreet
Name:Entrance to the comic book store
Description:You now stand before Stuart's Comics, a narrow storefront wedged between a vintage record shop and an antique furniture store on Pasadena's South Lake Avenue. The facade is unassuming with faded blue paint peeling slightly around the edges - a visual characteristic that aligns with the establishment's apparent ethos of prioritizing content over curb appeal.<p>A hand-painted sign above the door proclaims "The Comic Center of Pasadena - Since 1997" in a font reminiscent of classic superhero logos. The window display features a haphazard arrangement of vintage comics, action figures, and graphic novels - a curated chaos that suggests both passion and perhaps limited spatial organization capacity.<p>The sidewalk in front is adorned with faded promotional posters for obscure comic book titles and direct market specials dating back several years - evidence of Stuart's commitment to promoting niche publications. A faint aroma of aged paper and plastic mingles with the scent of roasting coffee from a neighboring cafe, creating a unique sensory profile indicative of specialized retail environments catering to dedicated hobbyists.<p>As you approach, you can hear snippets of conversation about variant covers, key issue values, and obscure character backstories emanating from within - a sonic signature identifying this as a sanctuary for comic book enthusiasts rather than casual browsers.

RoomID:comicbookstore
Name:The Comic Center of Pasadena
Description:The Comic Center of Pasadena presents as a specialized retail outlet catering primarily to collectors of vintage and contemporary comic books. The store occupies a modest space featuring densely packed shelving units displaying a wide range of titles across multiple genres.<p>While the selection is undeniably extensive - including several rare issues that would be of interest to serious collectors - the organization system appears somewhat idiosyncratic with categorization based on factors beyond standard publisher or title sequencing. I observed instances where books from different series were grouped together based on cover color schemes rather than chronological order.<p>The lighting could be improved as the current setup casts shadows across certain displays making detailed examination challenging. Additionally, a more robust inventory management system would enhance efficiency and potentially allow customers to locate specific items more quickly.<p>Despite these operational considerations, The Comic Center of Pasadena represents one of the few dedicated comic book stores remaining in our area - providing a valuable service for enthusiasts seeking physical copies rather than digital reproductions.
