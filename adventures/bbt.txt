# New adventure based on Big Bang theory
# Sheldon has to be driven to Caltech
# There's all kinds of set-backs and obstacles
# A bit of trivia
# Some puzzles
# A fight with an alien that comes from a portal Sheldon made
# Car trouble in Penny's car because of the neglected "Check Engine" light
# Map of the two apartments
# Stairs, no elevator
# Route to Caltech
# Stops at Amy's, Raj's, the comic book store, Bernadette and Howards's place

# Op straat staan twee auto's: Die van Leonard (hiervoor heb je sleutels) en die van Penny (nog geen sleutels)
# Met car keys van Leonard instappen lukt, maar starten niet. (modifier: penny in haar living room, in paniek omdat haar kleren gestolen zijn).
# Dan Penny overtuigen om met haar auto te mogen gaan (door haar haar kleren te geven krijg je haar autosleutels)
# Die strandt natuurlijk met motorpech
# Maar wel in de buurt van de comic book store
# Daar Stuart om hulp vragen en dan krijg je een onderdeel waarmee Penny's auto het weer doet.
#	Bij vragen geeft Stuart aan dat hij wel wil helpen, maar dat hij dat niet voor niets doet en wil ruilen voor een zeldzaam stripboek van Sheldon
#	Na het verlaten van de winkel moet je (en kun je nu ook) helemaal teruglopen naar het appartement en in Sheldon's slaapkamer is nu het stripboek te vinden.
#	Dan weer helemaal teruglopen en Stuart wil nu ruilen.
#	Met dat item kun je nu weer in de auto stappen en wegrijden

# Caltech
#	Sheldon moet perse zijn aanwijsstok hebben, die ligt in de kelder, maar Barry beheert de sleutel daarvan.
#	Barry ligt natuurlijk dwars en wil iets in ruil hebben
#	De onderdelen daarvoor moet je eerst vinden in de kantoren/labs van Amy, Howard en Raj
#	Je moet dan wat trivia vragen beantwoorden. Bernadette is in het lab van Howard
#	Je moet dan naar de kelder en daar het wezen uit de andere dimensie verslaan en dan heb je de aanwijsstok. 
#		Aangezien het wezen niet echt is en alleen een projectie, kun je met een sleutel de projectie uitschakelen. Die sleutel vind je in het kantoor van Sheldon.

# Na afloop moet je nog weer naar huis. De auto haalt het net en in het appartement zitten alle anderen al te wachten met take-out. Iedereen eet gezellig in de woonkamer.

RoomID:living
Name:Sheldon and Leonard's living room
Description:This is our familiar living room, isn't it? It's remarkable how time seems to warp within these walls. I can barely recall moving in, yet here we still are after all these years.<p>Living with Sheldon certainly doesn't accelerate the passage of time; rather, it feels as though each day stretches on interminably. Some moments expand into what feel like subjective eternities, while entire weeks sometimes vanish without a trace - lost in a fog of meticulously planned routines and unwavering principles.<p>It makes you wonder if certain living arrangements exist outside the normal flow of temporal experience...

Name:The kitchen
Description:Our kitchen is the embodiment of optimized functionality - a meticulously organized space where everything has a designated location and access follows efficiency protocols. Gleaming stainless steel appliances reflect under precisely positioned LED task lighting while countertops remain perpetually clear, offering unobstructed work surfaces.<p>The organization extends to every conceivable detail; cabinets feature custom dividers allowing instant visual inventory, spices are arranged alphabetically with expiration dates clearly marked, and utensils hang on magnetic strips spaced for ergonomic reach. Even seemingly minor elements adhere to strict standards - dish towels are folded according to a specific geometric pattern, trash cans have separate compartments for recyclables, and the refrigerator maintains precisely calibrated temperature zones.<p>This isn't merely tidiness but rather an engineered environment designed to minimize cognitive load.

RoomID:bedroomsheldon
Name:Sheldon's bedroom
Description:Stepping into Sheldon's bedroom is like entering a display model rather than a lived-in space - everything is precisely arranged according to established protocols. The walls are painted a neutral beige with minimal decorative elements beyond framed certificates and diagrams related to his academic achievements. The focal point of the room is undoubtedly the bed, which is made with surgical precision. The rest of the room follows a similar pattern: comic books are shelved alphabetically by author then chronologically by publication date; clothing items hang uniformly spaced in the closet; surfaces remain clear of clutter. Even seemingly random objects like desk organizers and charging stations adhere to strict geometric principles. It's not necessarily cozy or inviting in the conventional sense - more like an optimized environment designed for efficiency rather than relaxation - reflecting Sheldon's functional approach to all aspects of his life.

Description:The familiar chaos of Penny's living room greets you - throw pillows scattered like fallen soldiers, a landscape of magazines across the coffee table, and that indefinable layer of comfortable disarray that only comes from truly living in a space.<p>Across the room, Sheldon's face betrayed his internal battle; his eyes darted around cataloging the deviations from perfect alignment while his lips tightened against the instinctive urge to impose order. You could practically hear him calculating the precise trajectory needed to realign each object with maximum efficiency - a silent symphony of control battling a wave of joyful messiness.

RoomID:couch
Name:Penny's couch
Description:Penny's couch operates under its own unique physical laws - a gravitational anomaly where objects tend to accumulate rather than repel. The plush cushions are almost entirely obscured beneath layers of clothing, throw pillows in various states of fluffiness, and a selection of magazines spanning fashion and celebrity gossip.<p>Attempting to locate a seating surface requires archaeological excavation skills - carefully parting the textile strata to reveal patches of fabric that might qualify as "flat." The sheer volume of items suggests this isn't random clutter but rather a carefully curated ecosystem reflecting Penny's personal style and current interests.<p>Despite its apparent unsuitability for sitting, the couch maintains an aura of inviting comfort - the overflowing pillows hinting at cozy nights spent reading or watching movies while the scattered clothes suggest moments of casual relaxation rather than frantic disorganization. It's a space that prioritizes lived-in authenticity over pristine presentation - a perfect reflection of Penny herself.

It was undeniably organized, suggesting someone who valued efficiency and order in at least one domain of her life.<p>Yet something felt missing; the space lacked the lived-in warmth that comes with genuine culinary passion. There were no overflowing spice racks, no handwritten recipe cards pinned to the fridge, no evidence of joyful experimentation - just a clean slate awaiting its next utilitarian purpose. It was clear this kitchen served as a means rather than an end in itself, reflecting Penny's approach to cooking as sustenance rather than celebration.

Description:You now stand before Stuart's Comics, a narrow storefront wedged between a vintage record shop and an antique furniture store on Pasadena's South Lake Avenue. The facade is unassuming with faded blue paint peeling slightly around the edges - a visual characteristic that aligns with the establishment's apparent ethos of prioritizing content over curb appeal.<p>A hand-painted sign above the door proclaims "The Comic Center of Pasadena - Since 1997" in a font reminiscent of classic superhero logos. The window display features a haphazard arrangement of vintage comics, action figures, and graphic novels - a curated chaos that suggests both passion and perhaps limited spatial organization capacity.<p>The sidewalk in front is adorned with faded promotional posters for obscure comic book titles and direct market specials dating back several years - evidence of Stuart's commitment to promoting niche publications. A faint aroma of aged paper and plastic mingles with the scent of roasting coffee from a neighboring cafe, creating a unique sensory profile indicative of specialized retail environments catering to dedicated hobbyists.<p>As you approach, you can hear snippets of conversation about variant covers, key issue values, and obscure character backstories emanating from within - a sonic signature identifying this as a sanctuary for comic book enthusiasts rather than casual browsers.

The store occupies a modest space featuring densely packed shelving units displaying a wide range of titles across multiple genres.<p>While the selection is undeniably extensive - including several rare issues that would be of interest to serious collectors - the organization system appears somewhat idiosyncratic with categorization based on factors beyond standard publisher or title sequencing. I observed instances where books from different series were grouped together based on cover color schemes rather than chronological order.<p>The lighting could be improved as the current setup casts shadows across certain displays making detailed examination challenging. Additionally, a more robust inventory management system would enhance efficiency and potentially allow customers to locate specific items more quickly.<p>Despite these operational considerations, The Comic Center of Pasadena represents one of the few dedicated comic book stores remaining in our area - providing a valuable service for enthusiasts seeking physical copies rather than digital reproductions.

The air carries a faint scent of beeswax polish mingled with the subtle hum of ventilation systems maintaining precisely regulated temperature and humidity levels.<p>The stage itself is minimalist in design featuring a podium constructed from dark mahogany with an embedded microphone array capable of projecting clear audio throughout the hall - a feature Sheldon specifically requested for optimal clarity. Behind the podium, a retractable screen displays complex mathematical equations and temporal diagrams rendered in crisp vector graphics. The combination of architectural grandeur and meticulous personalization creates a unique atmosphere - both reverent toward academic tradition yet subtly tailored to Sheldon's exacting specifications for an ideal intellectual environment.<p>The lecture ends with a standing ovation and you meet up with Sheldon again where he states he needs sustenance. Isn't this over yet?!
Locks:laserpointer
UnlockTexts:You extended the laserpointer toward Sheldon who accepted it with mechanical efficiency. There was no verbal acknowledgement, no expression of gratitude beyond a microsecond flicker in his eyes as he registered its presence. The transfer complete, he immediately pivoted and strode toward the stage with purpose.<p>As he reached the podium, adjusting the microphone height to precisely 47 inches from the floor, a wave of applause erupted from the audience - a spontaneous demonstration of admiration for the man who was welcoming their approval. The sound seemed almost discordant against his clinical focus as he initiated his lecture on temporal displacement theory with characteristic precision: "Good evening. My research indicates..."<p>It's moments like these that encapsulate the paradox of Sheldon - someone whose intellectual brilliance commands widespread recognition yet remains largely insulated from social conventions, including those related to expressing appreciation for thoughtful gestures.
UnlockHints:Our progress was abruptly halted as Sheldon stopped dead in his tracks, his face adopting a look of utter consternation.

ItemDescription:The laserpointer itself is unremarkable by conventional standards - a small, cylindrical device constructed from molded plastic with a generic corporate logo barely visible beneath layers of wear. It emits a red beam at 635 nanometers wavelength with an output power of 5 milliwatts, placing it firmly in the category of mass-produced consumer electronics.<p>Yet for Sheldon, this particular laserpointer transcends its utilitarian function - it represents precision, control, and adherence to protocol. He acquired it after extensive comparative analysis of available models based on beam divergence, battery life, and ergonomic factors - selecting a variant that met his exacting standards despite lacking any distinguishing features beyond functional reliability.<p>The significance isn't inherent in the object itself but rather in its consistent performance across countless lectures, demonstrations, and impromptu explanations - it's become an extension of his cognitive processes rather than merely a pointing device. He maintains meticulous records of its usage including battery replacement dates, beam alignment checks, and even ambient temperature readings during critical presentations - treating it with reverence typically reserved for far more valuable instruments.

RoomID:labamy
Name:Amy's lab
Description:Stepping into Amy's lab is like entering a meticulously controlled environment - the air feels crisp and clean, the surfaces gleam without a trace of dust or clutter, and even the ambient lighting appears optimized for visual acuity rather than mere illumination. Everything occupies its designated space with geometric precision reflecting her commitment to both scientific rigor and aesthetic order.<p>The walls are painted in calming shades of blue-gray while equipment is arranged according to functional workflow - each instrument positioned precisely where it's needed for maximum efficiency. But what truly distinguishes this lab from others isn't just the cleanliness but rather Amy's unique approach to decoration:<p>Shelves typically reserved for textbooks or research papers instead display rows upon rows of hermetically sealed jars containing preserved brains representing a wide range of species - from rodents and primates to avian and even reptilian examples. Each specimen is meticulously labeled with both taxonomic classification and key neuroanatomical features highlighted in elegant calligraphy.<p>While some might find the decor unsettling, Amy views these biological artifacts as both aesthetically pleasing and intellectually stimulating - tangible representations of neural complexity that serve as constant reminders of the intricate structures she studies while simultaneously providing conversation starters for visiting colleagues who inevitably comment on "the brains."

Item:light saber
ItemDescription:This is an officially licensed, premium-grade lightsaber replica modeled after Anakin Skywalker's signature weapon - a coveted piece among collectors and enthusiasts alike. The hilt measures approximately 13 inches in length with a diameter that comfortably fills the hand while maintaining a balanced weight distribution indicative of meticulous engineering.<p>When activated, the hilt extends and emits authentic activation sounds while the polycarbonate blade glows intensely - replicating the visual signature of plasma containment without generating actual heat. While clearly not a functional weapon, the attention to detail extends even to subtle elements like engraved serial numbers and weathering patterns that suggest battle-worn authenticity. It's an object appreciated less for its destructive potential and more for its faithful recreation of iconic design and cultural significance - a tangible connection to a beloved fictional universe.
