# New adventure based on Big Bang theory
# Sheldon has to be driven to Caltech
# There's all kinds of set-backs and obstacles
# A bit of trivia
# Some puzzles

# Car trouble in Penny's car because of the neglected "Check Engine" light
# Map of the two apartments
# Stairs, no elevator
# Route to Caltech
# Stops at Amy's, Raj's, the comic book store, Bernadette and Howards's place

# Op straat staan twee auto's: Die van Leonard (hiervoor heb je sleutels) en die van Penny (nog geen sleutels)
# Met car keys van Leonard instappen lukt, maar starten niet. (modifier: penny in haar living room, in paniek omdat haar kleren gestolen zijn).
# Dan Penny overtuigen om met haar auto te mogen gaan (door haar haar kleren te geven krijg je haar autosleutels)
# Die strandt natuurlijk met motorpech
# Maar wel in de buurt van de comic book store
# Daar Stuart om hulp vragen en dan krijg je een onderdeel waarmee Penny's auto het weer doet.
#	Bij vragen geeft Stuart aan dat hij wel wil helpen, maar dat hij dat niet voor niets doet en wil ruilen voor een zeldzaam stripboek van Sheldon
#	Na het verlaten van de winkel moet je (en kun je nu ook) helemaal teruglopen naar het appartement en in Sheldon's slaapkamer is nu het stripboek te vinden.
#	Dan weer helemaal teruglopen en Stuart wil nu ruilen.
#	Met dat item kun je nu weer in de auto stappen en wegrijden

[Sheldon and Leonard's]
RoomID:living
Name:Sheldon and Leonard's living room
Description:This is our familiar living room, isn't it? It's remarkable how time seems to warp within these walls. I can barely recall moving in, yet here we still are after all these years.<p>Living with Sheldon certainly doesn't accelerate the passage of time; rather, it feels as though each day stretches on interminably. Some moments expand into what feel like subjective eternities, while entire weeks sometimes vanish without a trace - lost in a fog of meticulously planned routines and unwavering principles.<p>It makes you wonder if certain living arrangements exist outside the normal flow of temporal experience...

NegativeAskResponse:That falls outside my current domain of expertise. If I had been informed this inquiry would be posed, I would have allocated the requisite neural processing power for its consideration. Your failure to provide adequate notice is not a deficiency I am prepared to accept responsibility for.
NegativeTradeResponse:While I acknowledge the gesture, the item in question lacks characteristics aligned with my acquisition parameters. The transfer would represent a suboptimal allocation of resources - a concept I trust you understand is fundamentally inefficient.

RoomID:livingroompenny
Name:Penny's living room
Description:The familiar chaos of Penny's living room greets you - throw pillows scattered like fallen soldiers, a landscape of magazines across the coffee table, and that indefinable layer of comfortable disarray that only comes from truly living in a space.<p>Across the room, Sheldon's face betrayed his internal battle; his eyes darted around cataloging the deviations from perfect alignment while his lips tightened against the instinctive urge to impose order. You could practically hear him calculating the precise trajectory needed to realign each object with maximum efficiency - a silent symphony of control battling a wave of joyful messiness.

RoomID:kitchenpenny
Name:Kitchen
Description:Penny's kitchen presented a study in functional minimalism - counters wiped clean, appliances neatly arranged, and cabinets free from clutter. It was undeniably organized, suggesting someone who valued efficiency and order in at least one domain of her life.<p>Yet something felt missing; the space lacked the lived-in warmth that comes with genuine culinary passion. There were no overflowing spice racks, no handwritten recipe cards pinned to the fridge, no evidence of joyful experimentation - just a clean slate awaiting its next utilitarian purpose. It was clear this kitchen served as a means rather than an end in itself, reflecting Penny's approach to cooking as sustenance rather than celebration.

RoomID:bedroompenny
Name:Bedroom
Description:The decor was eclectic rather than coordinated - featuring posters from movies and TV shows she loves mixed with gifts from friends and family.<p>Clothes accumulated on chairs rather than being neatly hung in the closet, creating cozy piles that somehow never quite reached critical mass.<p>The sight of the unmade bed and the general disarray appeared to bypass Sheldon's rational faculties entirely, almost initiating a cascade of reflexive responses.

RoomID:bathroompenny
Name:Bathroom
Description:The light blue walls create an airy feel while reflecting available natural light effectively.<p>The vintage clawfoot tub is particularly noteworthy; its cast iron construction provides excellent thermal mass retention allowing for extended periods of comfortable water temperature - a property I find quite appealing from a thermodynamic perspective.<p>While the vanity shows signs of wear consistent with regular use, it maintains a certain charm that speaks to the room's history and lived-in quality. The eclectic assortment of personal items - framed prints, candles, soaps - suggest a space curated for comfort rather than strict aesthetic uniformity.

Description:Penny's VW Rabbit is a vehicle with visible history - the kind of car that tells stories through its dents, scratches, and accumulated character marks. The exterior paint job (originally blue) has faded unevenly from sun exposure creating mottled patches across the hood and roof. Several parking dings are evident along the doors and bumpers - each likely representing a memorable anecdote. The interior shows even more signs of lived-in charm:<br>- The seats are upholstered in worn cloth featuring mismatched patterns - a testament to previous repairs or Penny's eclectic taste<br>- A permanent collection of receipts, coins, and random trinkets inhabits the center console<br>- The dashboard is adorned with a vintage air freshener shaped like a daisy

The interior exhibits a functional Scandinavian design philosophy - minimalist yet ergonomic with intuitive controls and durable materials. While lacking some of the infotainment features found in newer models, the core functions operate reliably through physical buttons rather than touchscreen interfaces which I find more efficient during operation.

[ComicbookStore]
RoomID:comicbookstore
Name:On route to Caltech
Description:The Comic Center of Pasadena presents as a specialized retail outlet catering primarily to collectors of vintage and contemporary comic books. The store occupies a modest space featuring densely packed shelving units displaying a wide range of titles across multiple genres.<p>While the selection is undeniably extensive—including several rare issues that would be of interest to serious collectors—the organization system appears somewhat idiosyncratic with categorization based on factors beyond standard publisher or title sequencing. I observed instances where books from different series were grouped together based on cover color schemes rather than chronological order.<p>The lighting could be improved as the current setup casts shadows across certain displays making detailed examination challenging. Additionally, a more robust inventory management system would enhance efficiency and potentially allow customers to locate specific items more quickly.<p>Despite these operational considerations, The Comic Center of Pasadena represents one of the few dedicated comic book stores remaining in our area—providing a valuable service for enthusiasts seeking physical copies rather than digital reproductions.
